# SpellThiefAlpha
Test files for the game I'm working on: Spellthief

This current version is not a fully playable game, it has several features and the groundwork to start creating a game, some example of features are.


-Full fluid movement

-Fully functional bullets

-Hit registration on enemies and the player, includes a health variable for both entities

-Charge meter to fire a specific "Steal" shot, planned to interact with enemies

-Borders to prevent player from leaving area, also erases non-viewable objects for saving space

-Fully functional UI for health, "Steal!" meter, and cooldown

-Enemy AI and pathing using Bezier lines, curves, and splines for fluid parametric movement

-Many more small things that work between the listed features


I believe the code is as non static as possible, I have set it up so I can begin creating waves of enemies, enemies to spawn in the waves, bullets for the player and enemies, hazards, and image slots for spells.

Not related to code, but all of the graphics were also created by me, aswell.

I am uploading this current version as a demo for what I can achieve, if you have taken the time to read until the end of this I thank you.
